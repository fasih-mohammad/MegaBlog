//purpose of conf folder and file is to create a file that provides values of environmental variables , since sometimes enviromental variables are not loaded first , the whole application crashes to avoid that , we get access of all environmental variables as an object to use in our project anywhwere we want!!
const conf = {
    appwriteUrl: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL),
    appwriteProjectId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID),

    appwriteCollectionId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID),
    appwriteBucketId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID),
}
// there was a name issue with the import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL, it was later fixed in debugging video

export default conf
